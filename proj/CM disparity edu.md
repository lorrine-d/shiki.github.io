## Child Mortality Rate and Mother's Education Level
Mothers' level of education still has a significant independent effect on the risk of child mortality in most countries. Studies have shown that mothers' level of education is more important than household income in reducing under-5 mortality across developing countries with different demographic characteristics and political environments, and the difference increases with income.
- Estimated levels and trends in Child mortality rate by **mother's education level** for countries.
- Apply **Bayesian model** to impute for any country without data based on the posterior sample.
